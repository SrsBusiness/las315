Aztec World view:
    - Fate - everything predetermined
    - Covenant with the gods, and were thus involved in cosmic struggles
    - Polytheism - exact numbers are not known. Anthropomorphic, and often
    had aspects of both genders
    - Gods were usually forces of nature
    - Sacred spaces. Many layers of the world. No moral connotations
    associated with the layers


Identities of gods are always in question (relationships, etc.)
    - Written sources differ
    - Different traditions
    - Sometimes combined characteristics of many gods into one


Cipactli (crocodile god/monster?)
    - the earth rests on its back

Hell was in the north, where it was cold.

World divided into 4 cardinal directions:
    - Caves, ceremonial centers, households sacred

Ancestor worship was important. Remembered their lineages.
    - Communication with ancestors is often portrayed in art
    - Households often built on top of ancestral remains

Aztecs did not impose their religion on those they conquered. In fact, they
often assimilated cultures they conquer.

Birth Huitzilopochtli:
    - Name means "Hummingbird on the left" (left refers to south)
    - Takes place on Coatepec (Serpent Hill)
    - Coatlicue (Serpent Skirt): mother, was sweeping the floor, got pregnant
    under dubious circumstances involving a ball of feathers
    - daughter (Coyolxauhqui), decided along with her 400 brothers
    (Centzonhuitznahua) to kill Coatlicue
    - Huitzilopochtli suddenly is born and slays the sister and the brothers
    - Battle was an explanation for night/day

No monuments for Huitzilopochtli
    - 1 explanation: When Spanish came, they hid away his effigies
    - Instead of a physical idol, roleplayed with costumes

Bonus: Spell out the names

Human Sacrifices:
    - Historical precedences in other civilizations
    - Spanish would use this practice as a reason to conquer them (both to the
    king and to themselves)
    - Religious imagery depicts sacrifice

Xipe Totec (god of flaying?)
    - often depicted wearing human skins

Tlaltecuhtli (version of the earth monster, required human sacrifice to survive)
    - Stone tablet on top of which sacrifice was performed

Historical Sources on Sacrifice
    - Both Spanish and indigenous wrote about/portrayed it

Archaeological evidence on sacrifice
    - Chacmool - sacrificial stone portraying sacrifice. Vessel used for
    carrying blood and heart.
    - Sacrificial knives (flint and obsidian). Sometimes these were also
    effigies i.e. had religious iconography

Body count at the Aztec pyramid is lower than expected, but is evidence of
sacrifice

Children sacrificed to Tlaloc, god of rain. (Trading tears for rain)

Mictlantecuhtli - god of the dead. Important icon in sacrifices.
