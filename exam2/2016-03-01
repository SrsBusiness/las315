Gender and Empire

Q: Slaves
    1. POW (Prisoners of War)
    2. People who owed a lot of money
    Slavery somestimes entailed death, or simply forced labor (?)

Archaeology has a history of focusing on males (sometimes exclusively?) over
females

Legitimizing the present by pointing to historical precedences

Q: Problems with gender studies:
    - Anything related to gender is not approached critically
    - We have a lot of baggage e.g. contemporary values on gender
    - Often dismiss the roles of women (?)

Q: Historical documents (codices) can give ideas of gender roles, can give ideas
about attitudes towards those roles

Gender complementarity
    Men go to war, women stayed at home, but the impression was that they both
    participated on the battlefield

Q: Problems with the historical record:
    1. Provides ideas from the POV of the writer, who were pedominantly men
    2. Sources were written at a particular time, so there's a lack of 
    temporal depth
    3. Documents may leave out information the writers think are unimportant,
    but may actually be relevant

Distinction between sex and gender (biological vs social)

2 cases from historical documents:

'The Aztec Kings' - Susan Gillespie
    - Structural Analysis
        looked at many versions of the same story, and distilled the
        fundamental elements
    - Woman of discord
        Woman who initiated periods of chaos in the Aztec dynasty

    1st Case: Aztec Migration, First Aztec King
        Commonalities (?)
        - Left Aztlan
        - Found Tenochtitlan
        - Paid tribute to Azcapotzalco
        
        Acamapitchtli - first King,
            Rule came into question
            married (princesses from Azcapotzalco, Toltec)
                1. Ilancueitl 
                2. Atotoztli

            Sources that claim Ilancueitl:
                - wife
                - adoptive mother
                - sister
                - grandmother
                - sister-in-law
                - aunt

            Sources that claim Atotoztli
                - natural mother
                - wife
                - sister-in-law

            Wait is she really a man? (uncle)
            Incest was taboo for Aztecs
            Q: Reasons for committing incest:
                - display of power (he is above the law)
                - kept power in family
                - introduced chaos into the world, and resolved it (again,
                a display of power and legitimacy), gave impression he was a
                god

    2nd case: Tlacaelel and the cult of Cihuacoatl
        Cihuacoatl - deity
            - woman-snake
            - Fertility
            - fed with human sacrifice
            - Portrayed by the state more than anything else

        Avatars of Cihuacoatl
            - Chantico
            - Toci
            - Quilaztli
            - Cihuateotl
            ...

        Worshipped in the south, became important after Aztecs expanded there
            - also a very agriculturally productive area
        
        Itzcoatl: 4th Aztec King
            - Conquered South
            - First emperor: 1427 - 1440

        Tlacaelel
            - half brother of Itzcoatl
            - Dressed as Cihuacoatl (scandalous, cross-dressing taboo)
            - led conquest of the south
            - played a part in adoption of Cihuacoatl
            Q: Why did he dress as their god?
                - Display of power
                - Humiliation, as an insult
                Became 2nd most powerful man in the empire

Q: Advantages and problems with archaeological evidence:
    - can give information on all levels of society (supposedly)
    - provides evidence for time periods when there was no writing
    - can be destroyed
    - can be difficult to interpret
    - If combined with historical evidence, we can correct mistakes
    from both kinds of evidence
    - historical evidence can help in the interpretation of archaeological
    evidence

Aztec cooking and weaving:
    - According to colonial codices, primarily women
    - Before 1991 (Elizabeth M. Brumfiel's 'Weaving and Cooking:') no real studies on Aztec women
    - Documents are a good starting point for what women did/did not do. but are narrow
    - Some inconsistencies between written and illustrated sources
    - Some were healers, prostitutes, priestesses
    - Caretakers of domestic birds
    - Roles of women outside the capital were not as limited (allegedly)
    - Evidence: ceramics, spindle whorls
