Aztec Calendars:

Long tradition of calendars, for over a milennia

3 calendars:
    Tonalpohualli - 13 months x 20, 260 days
    Xihuitl - 18 x 20 + 5, solar year
    Calendar round: 52 year cycle in which two calendars met

    State taught all these calendars
    Used by everyone - commoners, elites

units 20 (total appendages on hands and feet)

Days represented as ${number}${month}

Tonalpohualli
    13 months, 1 for each layer of heaven
    Since ~30 CE
    Used all over Mesoamerica
    260 resonates with important natural events (gestation period of humans,
    Time interval between Venus being a morning and evening star, cycle of
    eclipses)
    Used as horoscopes


Sun Stone/Solar Calendar:
    Word Xihuitl actually means "moon"
    18 months of 20 days,
    5 days of bad luck
    Both Tonalpohualli and Xihuitl were used simultaneously
    Not known if everyone used the same solar calendar within the empire
    Year Bearer Signs - Only 4 days can begin a year in this calendar: Rabbit, House, Flint, Reed
    Kings liked to use Year Bearers to mark creations
    Grouped many events into one day to make them seem more significant (?)
    
    According to the Aztecs, the world was created and destroyed many times
    Stone documents days of creation in the past, and the current incarnation of creation (?),
        along with many other dates

Gods usually had dual aspects (both a male and female counterpart)

Calendar Round: Both calendars coincide in the names and number of the day every
    52 years

Q: What was significance of 52 year cycle?

The Aztec Empire (Top down perspective)
    - Formed in 1428 (Triple alliance)
    - Tenochtitlan ruled over 9 altepetl (towns), Texcoco 14, Tlacopan 7
    - Many different Kings
    - Core dependency, towns considered to be loyal to the kings, ready to serve immediately
    - Tribute system was convoluted, towns paying tribute to each other, to the capitals, who the hell knows
    - The King kept giving gifts to other kings and nobles eg. rights over land:
            
            King: I giff land to you, Noble
            Noble: Ok, I want their tribute too

            And voila, we have a cluster**** system of tributes

    - Kings will sometimes fight and take things by force
    - Kings of Tenochtitlan and Texcoco much more powerful than that of Tlacopan, and there was tension
    between te two

    - According to sources, people tried not to contradict King of Tenochtitlan
    - Elite intermarriages to strengthen alliances
    - Power over the empire was not uniform, it was complex
